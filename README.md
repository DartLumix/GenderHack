## 💡 About The Project

**HackTheGapP** is an application designed for female students (mid-grade / high school) to explore study paths free from stereotypes. The primary goal is to break down barriers regarding personal abilities and aptitudes, with a specific focus on **STEM** (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) subjects.

## 📱 Features

### 1. 👩‍🔬 BIG Minds' Stories (Interactive Mode)
The heart of the app. Users select a historical STEM figure (e.g., **Ada Lovelace**, **Margherita Hack**) and enter an interactive story.
* **Storytelling**: The character guides the user to solve a micro-problem related to their invention.
* **Philosophy**: No punitive "wrong answers." The goal is curiosity and empowerment.

### 2. 📊 Dashboard & Data Analysis
A visual tool providing insights into the job market and education landscape.
* **Profiling**: Visualizes aptitude (analytical-rational vs. pragmatic-creative).
* **Real Data**: Highlights gender gaps and enrollment statistics using real datasets.
* **Interactive Charts**: Filter data by Year, Region, and Gender via Bar and Pie charts.

### 3. 🏆 Gamification & Community
* **XP System**: Earn experience points by completing stories and exploring data.
* **Social**: (Coming Soon) Leaderboards and "Kahoot-style" classroom challenges.

### 4. 🧭 Orientation & Opportunities
* **Recommendations**: Directs users to schools/universities based on interests.
* **Integration**: Matches study topics with app stories.
* **Incentives**: Highlights scholarships and job offers promoting gender equality.
